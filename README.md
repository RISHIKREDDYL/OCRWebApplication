> **Note:** I did not write any code manually for this project. Instead, I utilized [Cursor](https://cursor.com) to generate all components including:
> - ✅ HTML structure  
> - ✅ CSS styling  
> - ✅ JavaScript functionality  
> - ✅ `README.md` documentation  

> This was primarily a fun experiment to explore AI-assisted development and learn Cursor's capabilities.
